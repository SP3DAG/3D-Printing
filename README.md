# 3D-Printing

This is the ReadMe.md file for the 3D-Printing process for the Study Project: Desinformation and Geomedia SoSe 2025
## Description

A 3D-printed phone case for the iPhone 16e that mimics the design of a digital camera. The case features an ergonomic grip for better handling while taking photos and an integrated Bluetooth shutter button for professional shots. This project combines modern smartphone technology with the nostalgic design of classic cameras.


## Features

* **Modular screw-together design** - Individual parts can be reprinted if damaged without replacing the entire case
* **Removable Bluetooth shutter button** - Button can be lifted out through a hinged flap for adjustment or (battery)replacement
* **Integrated tripod mount** - Bottom sleeve with threading allows direct attachment to standard tripods for stable phone positioning

## Print Settings

* **Printer:** Compatible printer models
* **Resolution:** Recommended layer height
* **Infill:** Recommended percentage
* **Supports:** Required or not
* **Material:** Recommended materials (PLA, PETG, ABS, etc.)
* **Nozzle Temperature:** Recommended temperature range
* **Bed Temperature:** Recommended temperature range

## Files Included

* [![Download STL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-STL%20File-blue?style=flat-square&logo=download)](./development/Final%20Release/iPhone%2016e%20Camera%20Case%20Final%20Release.stl) **iPhone 16e Camera Case Final Release** - These 3 objects allow you to choose what to print by toggling the visibility of different components and export it as a .stl file for the 3D printer

## Assembly Instructions

Make shure there are no printing errors and assemble the three parts together.

## Post-Processing

If needed you can sand the surface.
